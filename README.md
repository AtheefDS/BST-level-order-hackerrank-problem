# BST-level-order-hackerrank-problem
Binary Search Tree implementation in Python with insert and level-order traversal. The program builds a BST from user input and prints nodes using breadth-first search (BFS). Demonstrates recursion, tree structure handling, and queue-based traversal — useful for learning core data structures and algorithms basics
